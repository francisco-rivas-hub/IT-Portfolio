👨‍💻 IT-Portfolio — Francisco Javier Rivas Alfaro
Real-world IT infrastructure case studies executed in live enterprise production environments — covering OS deployment, identity management, network operations, endpoint security, HiTrust compliance, and infrastructure automation.
🧑‍🔧 About This Portfolio
This repository documents hands-on technical execution at a multi-campaign BPO enterprise supporting 7+ client organizations across dedicated VLANs and a shared Active Directory domain. Every project reflects direct on-site involvement — not lab simulations — including restricted-permission environments, cross-team coordination, and compliance-aligned evidence collection.
Demonstrated Role: On-Site Infrastructure Engineer / Junior Systems Administrator / HiTrust Compliance Officer (Onsite IT)

🏷️ Execution Classification
Each case study is tagged with one of two roles:
Direct Executor — Francisco personally performed the technical action on-site
Technical Validator — Francisco coordinated, escalated, or validated an action by another team
⚠️ All case studies reflect work in live production environments. Sensitive identifiers (hostnames, IPs, usernames) have been anonymized to protect organizational confidentiality.

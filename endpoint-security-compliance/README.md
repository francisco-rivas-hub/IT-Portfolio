Endpoint Security & Compliance Validation
Overview
Enterprise security validation initiative executed on-site, focused on endpoint integrity, EDR investigation, encryption posture verification, and audit-aligned documentation in a regulated production environment.
This case documents direct execution of endpoint-level security validation supporting compliance frameworks and enterprise security controls.
Operational Context
The production environment required continuous validation of:
Endpoint encryption posture
EDR operational integrity
Alert classification accuracy
Audit evidence alignment
Compliance control verification
All validation, investigation, and technical confirmation described below were executed directly at endpoint level in a live enterprise environment.
EDR Investigation & Threat Classification
CrowdStrike Alert Analysis
On-site investigation of security alerts
MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping (including T1490 classification scenarios)
Differentiation between false positives, benign true positives, and actionable risks
Process tree validation
Native Windows process behavior analysis
Focus: Accurate threat classification before escalation to higher security tiers.
Encryption & TPM Posture Validation
Direct verification of BitLocker encryption status
Recovery key validation workflows
TPM provisioning confirmation
Remediation of encryption-related inconsistencies
Focus: Maintain endpoint encryption compliance aligned with enterprise data protection requirements.
Host-Level Log & Event Validation
Windows Event Viewer analysis
Investigation of restore and recovery-related events
Validation of system behavior against expected administrative actions
Filtering Platform review when network-related behavior required deeper inspection
Focus: Distinguish legitimate operational activity from suspicious behavior.
Compliance Execution Support
Provided on-site technical validation for enterprise compliance controls, including:
Access management validation
Endpoint configuration confirmation
Encryption posture documentation
Structured evidence preparation aligned with audit requirements
All evidence collection and technical validation at endpoint level were executed directly.
Technical Constraints
Limited backend-level visibility
Restricted access to certain centralized compliance systems
Dependency on cross-team confirmation for final audit acknowledgment
Despite these constraints, endpoint-level validation and classification were fully executed on-site.
Operational Impact
Prevented unnecessary security escalations
Reduced false positive classification risk
Maintained encryption compliance posture
Improved audit response readiness
Increased endpoint-level security visibility
Skills Demonstrated
Direct endpoint security investigation
MITRE ATT&CK framework application
EDR alert triage
BitLocker lifecycle validation
TPM posture verification
Compliance-aligned documentation
Risk classification under operational constraints

# Active Directory Structural Remediation Initiative

## Overview

Infrastructure remediation initiative focused on stabilizing Active Directory operations after workstation relocation and legacy naming conflicts.

The objective was to eliminate recurring authentication failures and improve overall domain hygiene.

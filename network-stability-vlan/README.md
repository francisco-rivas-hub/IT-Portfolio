# Production Network Stability & VLAN Governance

## Overview

Network stabilization initiative focused on restoring connectivity and preventing production disruptions in a segmented multi-campaign environment.

---

## Incident Types Addressed

- VLAN misassignments
- Switch port failures
- Authentication failures due to incorrect segmentation
- Packet loss and intermittent connectivity
- URL blocking affecting Microsoft 365 and client portals

---

## Technical Interventions

### VLAN Validation & Correction
- MAC address collection and validation
- Layer 2 switch port verification
- Coordination for VLAN reassignment
- Post-change connectivity confirmation

### Physical Port Diagnostics
- Identification of failed switch ports
- Endpoint relocation to validated ports

### Network Monitoring
- Extended ICMP monitoring sessions (2-hour validation)
- Packet loss investigation
- Post-remediation stability testing

---

## Results

- Prevented multi-campaign production outage
- Reduced authentication issues caused by VLAN mismatch
- Improved Layer 2 troubleshooting workflow
- Strengthened cross-team coordination process

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Layer 2 Networking Fundamentals
